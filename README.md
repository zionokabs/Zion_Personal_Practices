# Learning to be a Software Engineer
This repository was created to save some of the codes that were written while learning with [**Topman Paul-Dike**](https://github.com/tpauldike) and as well to submit the assignments given by him and of course to save some things that I did while practicing personally.

Feel free to ask me questions on anything that catches your interest here.
